# CyberID WP Plugin
Customized CyberID WordPress Plugin

Victor was approached by Cyber ID Guard to customize the plugin, addressing several issues.

## Issues Addressed:
1. Not passing disconnect info to API
2. Fix visibility / sync issues on API status
3. Make product inputs more flexible for API fields
4. Visibility and search options for license number and other fields â€“ They had no way to search by license
5. Subscription and License statuses change unnecessarily on renewal

## Project Completed
All issues were address successfully and the plugin is running in production at https://cyberidguard.com.
